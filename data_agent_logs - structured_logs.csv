 The user wants to see all allergies for a specific patient with ID 03c5df71-2c83-aa6e-283e-2fbe6cb3dee9. This is a question about patient health data, so I delegated the query to the Data-Navigator-Agent and specified the patient_id in the search context to ensure the results are specific to this individual.
 
 Data-Navigator-Agent returned:
 ""There are no allergy records found for the patient with ID 03c5df71-2c83-aa6e-283e-2fbe6cb3dee9.""
 
 Reasoning and interpretation:
 The agent searched the health records for this specific patient and found no documented allergies. This means that, according to the existing information in the patient's medical chart, there are no known allergies on file. It's important to understand that ""no allergy records found"" may mean either that the patient truly has no known allergies, or that the information simply hasn't been entered or updated in the medical system.

 Final response:
 
 There are no documented allergies on file for this patient. If you believe there are allergies that should be recorded, please contact the healthcare provider to update the medical records.

 Here's what was found:
 - There are a mix of health-related conditions (like acute bronchitis, viral sinusitis, severe anxiety, social isolation, and stress) and some records that relate to life or social circumstances (such as employment status or being a victim of intimate partner abuse).
 - The list includes both current (active) and historical conditions, along with the timeframes during which they were recorded.
 - Not all findings are medical diagnoses; for example, ""medication review due"" is a status about needed follow-up, and employment status is included for social context.

 - ""SNOMED Code"" refers to a standardized medical classification system used across healthcare.
 - ""Active"" means the condition was noted as ongoing during the indicated period.

This limits my ability to retrieve all of the requested information directly via GraphQL at this time.
 However, I can help you craft more precise queries or suggest how to perform such detailed patient summaries if the GraphQL API's capabilities (such as filtering or parameterized queries) can be clarified or corrected. If you can provide the correct way to fetch records for a specific patient, or if you would like sample SQL queries for a direct database query, I can provide those instead.
 Would you like:
 - Sample SQL for such a report directly from the database?
 - To try with a different query format for the API?
 - Or to troubleshoot and correct the way the GraphQL API is called?
 Let me know how youÃ†d like to proceed!",,,"Reasoning:
 I attempted to request a thorough, all-inclusive summary for this patient, covering encounters, questionnaire responses, medications, allergies, conditions, diagnoses, and observations. However, there is a current technical limitation: the available system cannot use the patient ID directly to filter all resources (such as via ""id"" or ""filter"" arguments in the API). This means that, while I can access previously retrieved data (like encounters and conditions), I am unable to compile a complete and up-to-date summary for all requested categories (especially questionnaires, medications, diagnoses, and observations) in a single step.
 
 Previously, I have reported:
 - All encounters (routine checkups and symptom visits)
 - Documented conditions (medical, behavioral, and social findings)
 - No allergies found
 - Medication information not available
 - No patient questionnaire or observation data could be retrieved
 
 If you would like, I can present a summary combining what has already been found, but new or additional information (including questionnaires, diagnoses, or detailed medication history) is not accessible due to system limitations.
 
 </think>
 
 Final response:
 
 IÃ†m unable to provide a fully detailed patient summary across all categories due to current system limitationsÃ¹the data system does not allow pulling all information by patient ID at once. HereÃ†s what I can summarize from previously retrieved information:
 
 - Encounters: The patient has had multiple wellness exams and visits for symptoms from 2012 through March 2025.
 - Conditions: Documented conditions include stress, severe anxiety (panic), social isolation, acute bronchitis, viral sinusitis, pharyngitis, victim of intimate partner abuse, and some social context findings (employment/education).
 - Allergies: No allergies have been recorded.
 - Medications: No medication data could be retrieved.
 - Questionnaires & Observations: No data available or accessible at this time.
 
 If you need further helpÃ¹such as a report using specific alternative queries, or if the data platform allows search by patient in a different wayÃ¹please let me know.
